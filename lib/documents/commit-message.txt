refactor(strings): Move hardcoded text to centralized string constants

This commit refactors components to use centralized string constants:

- Created commonStrings object in constants.ts for shared texts (copyright, important notices)
- Added step3Texts object in strings.ts with subtitle content and validation messages
- Updated step1, step2, and step3 components to reference centralized strings
- Extracted all validation error messages to reusable string constants
- Structured string constants for better organization and maintainability
- Separated UI text from component logic for easier maintenance
- Prepared codebase for potential future internationalization
- Improved consistency of text across components
- Enhanced readability by removing inline hardcoded text
- Added better semantic structure for form validation messages

These changes improve the maintainability of the application by centralizing all text content, making it easier to update text without modifying component logic, and laying groundwork for potential localization.
