refactor(ui): Update UI to match Mexico Quiz interface

This commit includes several UI changes to make our quiz interface visually identical to the Mexico Quiz version:

- Refactored all Step and Credit Card Form components with updated text content
- Fixed VisitorCounter component styling and placement
  - Styled as a blue rounded badge with white text on all steps
  - Removed duplicate counter that was appearing at the bottom
- Added "Importante:" warning text with orange highlight
- Updated copyright information to use 2025 as the current year
- Added copyright text to all steps for consistency
- Replaced English text in blue container with Spanish equivalents
- Adjusted styling throughout to match the Mexico Quiz visual design

These changes ensure our UI is visually consistent with the Mexico Quiz while maintaining the same underlying functionality.
