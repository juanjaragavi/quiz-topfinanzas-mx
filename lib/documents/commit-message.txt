chore(scripts): Simplify deployment script and add string constants backup

This commit enhances the deployment process with focused string constants backup:

- Added dedicated backup for constants.ts and strings.ts files
- Created timestamped backup directories for easier recovery
- Removed all validation code for TypeScript files
- Eliminated unnecessary JSON validation
- Simplified deployment flow to be more straightforward
- Maintained error handling and status reporting
- Optimized script for speed and simplicity
- Streamlined the backup process with clear separation of concerns
- Focused on core deployment functionality without overhead
- Reduced complexity while retaining reliability features

These changes ensure our centralized string constants are properly backed up while making the deployment process cleaner and more efficient without validation overhead.
