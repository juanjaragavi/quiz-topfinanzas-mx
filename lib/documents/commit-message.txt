feat(form): Add comprehensive form validation and optimize development

This commit includes major improvements to form validation and development workflow:

- Replaced div with proper form structure in Step3 component
- Added comprehensive email validation with Spanish error messages
- Implemented robust validation for all fields (name, lastName, phone)
- Added Mexican phone number validation with LADA code checking 
- Created a centralized error state management system for all form fields
- Added visual indicators for validation state with proper error styling
- Fixed form submission process for better UX and accessibility
- Added real-time validation as users type with appropriate feedback
- Removed deprecated @next/font package in favor of built-in next/font
- Added Turbopack configuration for faster local development
- Created documentation for Turbopack in TURBOPACK.md
- Fixed HTML nesting issues to resolve hydration errors

These changes significantly improve the form user experience with culturally appropriate Spanish error messages while also enhancing the development workflow with faster rebuilds using Turbopack.
