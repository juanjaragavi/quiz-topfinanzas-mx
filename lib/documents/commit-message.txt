chore(scripts): Update deployment script for string constants backup

This commit enhances the deployment process with improved backup for string constants:

- Added dedicated backup for constants.ts and strings.ts files
- Created timestamped backup directories for easier recovery
- Implemented TypeScript validation for string constant files
- Removed unnecessary JSON validation code
- Updated deployment flow to focus on TypeScript files 
- Added error handling with proper backup restoration
- Optimized script for more robust deployments
- Improved logging and status reporting
- Streamlined the backup process with clear separation of concerns
- Enhanced the deployment process for better reliability

These changes ensure our centralized string constants are properly backed up and validated during deployment, reducing the risk of errors and improving the overall reliability of the deployment process.
